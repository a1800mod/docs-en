# Installing Mods

!> Every modifikation to the game, might be a security risk for the computer.

## Sources
There are multiple sources for mods. It is up to the modder, where and when he wants to upload the mods. The given sources are examples, there are more platforms. With the implemention of the ingame mod browser, which is using the [mod.io](http://mod.io) platform, its probably the most comfortable choice for modders and players to use.

1. [Mod.io / ingame browser](https://mod.io/g/anno-1800)
2. [Github.com](https://github.com/)
3. [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/)

## Manual installation

Mods can be installed manually. This is possible by downloading the mod from your desired source. After that you can either put the .zip or the extracted folder into the desired [path](/en/basics/path). It shouldn't be installed into the mod.io folder. The downside is, you (the user) have to keep track about updates. Folder can also be installed in choosen [path](/en/basics/path) via git, if the repository is aviable in github.

# Troubleshooting

When having trouble installing mods, or getting them to work the usual way is at fellows:

1. Update installed mods.
2. Check mod-loader.log [(ref. path)](/en/basics/path?id=mod-loaderlog)
3. Check installed mods for known compatibility problems.
4. Check Anno 1800 for problems (very files in Ubisoft launcher).
5. Deactivate all other mods except for the one that is causing trouble and check if that works. If it works it is a compatibility problem, check the mod info or ask in the help forum on the [discord](https://discord.gg/4XQTznE).
