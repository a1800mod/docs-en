# Coding Programs

Editors or IDE's need to be able to view XML files. Though this can be easily done by every viewer and editor, not every program can properly open a file as big as the <mark>assets.xml</mark>. VSCodium and Visual Studio Code have a plugin ([Anno Modding Tools](https://github.com/anno-mods/vscode-anno-modding-tools)), which can help coding anno mods.

# Extracting Programs

There are multiple programs to extract data from Anno 1800, depending on what is needed the choice of the right tool is necessary.

## RDA Extractor

The [RDA Extractor](https://github.com/lysannschlegel/RDAExplorer) is one of the basic tools, for extracting the .rda files from Anno 1800. Inside the .rda files are various files which Anno 1800 uses and mostly are modifiable. From Camerasettings, UI-Tweaks and the most important file, the assets.xml.
